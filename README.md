# Demarch Management System

I wanted to share my project in Fırat University Software Engineering Object Oriented course in my github account.

After running Setup.exe in my project, the only thing to do is pass the steps.

Run the file that has the .exe extension in the Setup File.

If you have Access DB on your computer, it won't be a problem.

Passwords for first use
  (Admin5-0144)

On the next use, there are places you can change the Password on the Home screen.
